        <section class="detail-item one">I’m Heather, a software developer based out of New York City. I would consider myself a jack-of-all-trades, master of none when it comes to technology. I have built and worked on full-stack projects but lean more towards frontend development. 
        </section>

        <section class="detail-item">I have worked in technology for 12 years, 6 years in tech startups from series A to unicorn status and 5 years in leadership roles. I spent those years on the business side building and leading client-facing teams to achieve retention goals. After many years of working closely with end-users, the product, and engineer team, I decided to dive deeper into the ‘tech’ side of tech companies. I switched gears and took a 400-hour software engineering immersive program (aka bootcamp) to fast-track my knowledge and now build the software I used to sell! </section>
        <section class="detail-item">I enjoy learning about and experimenting with new technology and have experience with different languages and frameworks, both front-end and back-end. I like to focus on front-end and especially like using frameworks like React and libraries like Bootstrap to help streamline the build and design process for a polished product.</section>
        <section class="detail-item">In my free time, I enjoy exploring all that NYC has to offer—amazing restaurants, live shows, and cool neighborhood hangouts. I go to upstate New York over summers to hike, and my husband and I run a dog-sitting business. </section>
